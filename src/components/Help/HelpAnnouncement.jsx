      <b>If you're having problems</b> streaming videos, it could indicate a problem with the Internet Archive server or their internet connection. The best thing to do is to verify that your device is working by playing a <a class="fw-bold" href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> video. If the YouTube video plays correctly, <b>it could mean that the Internet Archive servers are having temporary problems</b>. The best thing to do is wait awhile and try again later. Free TV is dependent on the Internet Archive servers to stream videos. <b>If they're having problems, so are we!</b>
